## 为什么使用ARC

Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is a compiler feature that provides automatic memory management of Objective-C objects. Rather than having to think about retain and release operations, ARC allows you to concentrate on the interesting code, the object graphs, and the relationships between objects in your application.

从苹果[官方文档](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226)来看，他是希望你把重心放在代码上，而不是考虑retain、release这些东西。

## 使用规则

* You cannot explicitly invoke dealloc, or implement or invoke retain, release, retainCount, or autorelease.The prohibition extends to using @selector(retain), @selector(release), and so on.You may implement a dealloc method if you need to manage resources other than releasing instance variables. You do not have to (indeed you cannot) release instance variables, but you may need to invoke [systemClassInstance setDelegate:nil] on system classes and other code that isn’t compiled using ARC.Custom dealloc methods in ARC do not require a call to [super dealloc] (it actually results in a compiler error). The chaining to super is automated and enforced by the compiler.You can still use CFRetain, CFRelease, and other related functions with Core Foundation-style objects (see Managing Toll-Free Bridging).

* You cannot use NSAllocateObject or NSDeallocateObject.You create objects using alloc; the runtime takes care of deallocating objects.

* You cannot use object pointers in C structures.
Rather than using a struct, you can create an Objective-C class to manage the data instead.

* There is no casual casting between id and void *.You must use special casts that tell the compiler about object lifetime. You need to do this to cast between Objective-C objects and Core Foundation types that you pass as function arguments. For more details, see Managing Toll-Free Bridging.

* You cannot use NSAutoreleasePool objects. ARC provides @autoreleasepool blocks instead. These have an advantage of being more efficient than NSAutoreleasePool.

* You cannot use memory zones. There is no need to use NSZone any more—they are ignored by the modern Objective-C runtime anyway.

* To allow interoperation with manual retain-release code, ARC imposes a constraint on method naming:

* You cannot give an accessor a name that begins with new. This in turn means that you can’t, for example, declare a property whose name begins with new unless you specify a different 

```
getter:
// Won't work:
@property NSString *newTitle;
 
// Works:
@property (getter=theNewTitle) NSString *newTitle;
```
